# GMS2 Organizer
A small app to organize GMS2 project resources.

## Why?
This was made because organizing resources in GMS2 is broken. This app automatically organizes all resources alphabetically, prioritizing folders to the top.

## How do I download?
Clone this repo and build it yourself:

## Build it yourself
```
$ git clone https://github.com/christopherwk210/gms2-organizer.git
$ cd gms2-organizer && npm install
$ npm run package.win64
```
To simply run it,
```
$ npm start
```
